                        <h2 class="text-center">Tech Background</h2>
                        <p class="text-center">My computer interests all started my sophomore year of high school. I had always been a tech kid, but I wanted to start a project that challenged my knowledge and allowed for more future opportunities. This was when I 
                            decided to build my own custom PC. I researched what I needed to do and ended up building the PC that I still use to this day. I enjoyed this project so much that I offered to build my friends PC's as well, all they had to do was buy the parts.
                            I ended up building 3 of my friends computers over the next year. I then wanted to learn more about how games and applications work and this led me to my first programming classes in high school. These classes led me to become a Computer Science major.
                            Once I started learning more in my classes at St. Thomas, it expanded exponentially. I am always on the look out for new topics to learn and ways to perfect my skills. I have never had a doubt in my mind about what I wanted to do for a career because I know this is what I love to do.

                        <p class="text-center">I recently graduated early in December 2023 and am eager to start my career. In the long term I hope to work my way up the ladder at a company that will not only help me further my career but also help make people's lives easier. I also hope to continue various different projects on my own time to strengthen my skills and also to have some fun with my own creativity. These projects include app development, web design, and a few hardware focused projects. I look forward to making things that can help or entertain others.</p>
